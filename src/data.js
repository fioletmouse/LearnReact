    info: "For some purists, espresso is the king of coffees and the only true way to drink the stuff. The espresso is where it all \n\
    starts: without espresso, none of the other drinks on this list would be possible. Espresso is made by forcing pressurized \n\
    hot water at a temperature of about 190-200°F (88-93°C) through a small amount of finely ground beans. The result is a thick, \n\
    rich and intense shot of coffee with a golden “crema” on top. Many people believe espresso has a higher caffeine content \n\
    than other coffees. This is true if you are measuring by volume – but there is a higher dose of caffeine in a regular cup\n\
     of drip coffee or coffee made with a French press since there is simply more of it. There are many factors to consider \n\
     when making espresso, including beans, grind, amount of coffee, time, temperature and pressure. Check out this video to see \n\
     how they all combine to make the perfect shot."
